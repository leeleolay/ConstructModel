# Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) Calculator

This script calculates the Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) and diffusion coefficient for a specific atom type from a LAMMPS trajectory file. It can also plot the MSD and diffusion coefficient.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you need to have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- concurrent.futures

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm

shell
Copy code

## Usage

python msd_calculator.py <traj_file> <target_atom_type> <min_timestep> <max_timestep> <num_processes>

markdown
Copy code

- `<traj_file>`: Path to the LAMMPS trajectory file
- `<target_atom_type>`: Target atom type for MSD calculation (integer)
- `<min_timestep>`: Minimum timestep to consider (integer)
- `<max_timestep>`: Maximum timestep to consider (integer)
- `<num_processes>`: Number of processes to use for parallel calculation (integer)

For example:

python msd_calculator.py run.lammpstrj 2 0 1000 4

bash
Copy code

This command calculates the MSD and diffusion coefficient for atom type 2 from the `run.lammpstrj` file, considering timesteps 0 to 1000, using 4 processes.

## Output

The script will output the calculated diffusion coefficient in the console:

Diffusion Coefficient: 0.16666666666666688

vbnet
Copy code

It will also generate two plot files:

- `msd_plot.png`: A scatter plot of Mean Squared Displacement vs. Time Delta
- `diffusion_coefficient_plot.png`: A bar plot of the diffusion coefficient

## Notes

This script is designed to handle large LAMMPS trajectory files efficiently by using parallel processing and memory optimization techniques. However, the performance may vary depending on the available system resources. Adjust the number of processes accordingly to optimize the performance on your system.
